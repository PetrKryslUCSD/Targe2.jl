 WHAT IS HERE
 =========================================================================

        o README        this file
        o t1 ... t111   sample test problems
        o run_tests     script to run the checks


        Run the tests as

                ksh run_tests [ options ]

        The options are described briefly by the program itself, if it
is run without any options.  More on these should appear in the User's
guide (which was not ready as of Nov 1994).  Here it should be noted, 
that the most useful option is "-X" which lets you view the generation
progress interactively in X Window System based viewer.

        The results of the checks are in the file "test.log".
