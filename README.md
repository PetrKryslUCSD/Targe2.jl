Targe2.jl implements an interface to the C-language program
Targe2 for advancing-front triangulation of two-dimensional regions
with arbitrary boundaries and vertex and curve constraints.

## Usage

Examples of inputs can be found in the srcoftests.jl  source file 
in the test folder. The folder "samples"  holds pretty much 
the same information in individual files.

The User's Guide in PDF form is available in the "doc" folder.
